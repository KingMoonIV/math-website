<h1>Central Tendency</h1>
<p>Central tendency is a way to describe a typical or average value in a group of numbers. It helps us understand where most of the numbers are centered. There are three common ways to measure central tendency: mean, median, and mode.</p>
<p1>For example, if the government takes a census of how many people live in different neighborhoods, they might use the mean (average) to find out how many people, on average, live in each neighborhood. This helps them make decisions about resources, like schools or hospitals, based on the typical number of people in each area.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<p2>Let's read this example. This set of numbers records in one community, how many people are currently living in a house.</p2>
<br>
<br>
<p3> 2, 3, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 4, 3, 4, 4, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 </p3>
<br>
<h2> How to find the mean </h2>
<p4>To find the central tendency for this set of numbers, we can first find the mean (average). First, we will add up the numbers in the set.</p4>
<br>
<br>
<p5> 1. 2+3+3+5+2+4+5+2+4+3+4+4+7+1+2+3+4+6=64. </p5>
<br>
<br>
<p6> Now, we have to divide the sum by the numbers in this set. For this set, there are 18 numbers.
<br>
<br>
<p7> 2. 64/18=3.6 </p7>
<br>
<br>
<p8> Now, we have found our answer which is 3.6. To remember this, we can use the formula for the mean. </p8>

<h2> How to find the median </h2>
<p9> To find the median, we have to first organize the set from least to greatest. </p9>
<br>
<br>
<p10> 1. 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7 </p10>
<br>
<br>
<p11> Now, we will have to find the middle number, which is the median. So by looking in the chart, we find there is no middle number. The closest 2 numbers are 3 and 4. For cases like these, we just find the middle of these numbers, which is 3.5 (our median). </p11>
<h2> How to find the mode </h2>
<p12> To find the mode, we have to simply just look back at out set we made earlier for the median, and find the number which repeats the most. For this case, the number 4 repeats 5 times, which is the greatest of all. </p12>
<h2> Summary </h2>
<p13> All 3 of these terms help form the concept of central tendency, which is the analysis of set of numbers and finding the average, middle number and the number that repeats the most. </p13>
